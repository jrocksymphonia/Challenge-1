# Challenge-1: HTML, CSS, and Git Code Refactor
Week 1 Challenge Focus: Accessibility and Semantic Tags

## Description

This project is intended to help my client (Horiseon Marketing Agency) have a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that their site is optimized for search engines. For this to happen I changed the title element in the head to reflect that the website is a homepage, I changed the non-semantic < div > elements into clear semantic elements to define what each section and subsections are in the body, I gave each image an accessible alt attribute consicely describing the contents of the image, and both the HTML and the CSS follow a logical structure that is easily readable for the coder and doesn't disrupt the flow order for the computer.  

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Open Google Chrome DevTools or any other code inspection tool on your default browser to view the HTML setup. Check out the title elements and the alt attributes in the image elements for the updated and improved descriptions. Scroll through the fully organized CSS and see how each selector can be easily traced back to its HTML element just by organization alone.
